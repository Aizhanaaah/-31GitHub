      Here's what you learned:

      while loop: while(){..} 
      do...while loop: do{...}while();
      for loop: for(int i=0; i<x; i++){}
      foreach loop: foreach(int item in list){}
      jump statements: break, continue, return

      The project that I am going to work on is focused on limiting the screentime and surfing the social media.
